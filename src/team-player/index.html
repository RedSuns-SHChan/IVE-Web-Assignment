				<p>Kenny “kennyS” Schrub is the new AWPer of G2 Esports. In 2012, Kenny emerged as one of the top AWPers in the CS: Source scene, which earned him a move to the legendary VeryGames team. Over the last three years, kennyS has had a big evolution in his game, to the point that he is now regarded as the most well-rounded sniper in the game.</p>
				<p>Kenny not only helped to break the rifle dominance during the early stages of CS:GO but he also proved that it is possible for an AWPer to become the best player in the world. In the last four years, he has been ever present in HLTV’s top 20 player ranking, placing sixth in 2014 and 2015.</p>

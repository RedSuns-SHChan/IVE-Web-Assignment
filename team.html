					<p>Richard “shox” Papillon has been at the top of the pile since the early days of CS:GO, and his presence in HLTV.org’s Top 20 year rankings in the last three years is proof of that. Boasting an incredible rating of 1.13 – one of the highest among top CS:GO players -, shox is heralded as one of the most versatile players in the game, and he will be looking to inspire the team to win international silverware after clinching a major title in 2014.</p>
